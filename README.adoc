RPM Spec file for https://github.com/oblique/create_ap[create_ap]

== Building

NOTE: This assumes you already copied the `build-rpm.sh` script from https://github.com/SMARTRACTECHNOLOGY/rpmdevtools-docker[rpmdevtools-docker] to a `${PATH}` accessible place.

First you need to get the source code, which if you're on a Linux system can be done by running:

[source, bash]
----
spectool -g *spec
----

Otherwise, just get the `Source0` field and download the tarball.

[source, bash]
----
build-rpm
----

== Installation

This RPM is included in the Lifecycles Base Repository, so assuming that is properly configured, you can just install it with:

[source, bash]
----
sudo dnf install -y create_ap
----

This file will also be installed as part of a gateway kickstart.
